Currently you can add the `BobbleSliderContainer` easily programatically.

Conform your ViewController (or any other object) to the `SliderThemeProvider` protocol. Default values of the expected theme properties have already been provided in the extension for this protocol.

Check the implementation in the `ViewController` file.

If you add it via the Interface Builder, you will get the default theme out of the box. Need to add this support (TODO to self)
You can still manually change the values in the default properties to get your own custom look.

Will be adding more documentation soon!
